# John-Richardson---C++-code

Welcome, to my GitHUB all the code in here is coding pratices I've learned at both Pulaski Technical and at the University of Arkansas. This is currently just the start to what I've done
and I'll be sure to add more as I continue. 

In this GITHUB You should be able to see assignements/Projects that I've completed in Data structures, Computer science 1-2.
